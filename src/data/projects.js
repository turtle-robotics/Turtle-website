    subtitle: "6-DOF Prosthetic Ankle",
    description:
      "The inspiration from this project came from wanting to gain a better understanding of fundamental robotics principles and combine that with an area of study that both excites students and can lead to an increase in the quality of life of those missing appendages. Many lower-leg prosthetic devices on the market currently have two main issues: asymmetric gait patterns and decreased mobility. Asymmetric gait patterns come about from the prosthesis not being able to replicate the energy output of the biological ankle, thus making the user exert more energy to walk and compensate using other parts of the body. This gait asymmetry can lead to fatigue, discomfort, and in many cases, lead to additional medical complications. Most prostheses also significantly limit the Range of Motion (RoM) of the user (roll, pitch, yaw), which could limit the user from being able to participate in certain activities.\n\nANKL was founded to develop a novel active ankle prosthesis to try and tackle these gait and mobility issues for below-the-knee amputees.\n\nTo achieve this goal, this project must first and foremost be comfortable and easy to integrate with current prosthesis mounts on the market. In addition to this comfort, this prosthesis needs to function whilst moving across various types of terrain (slopes, level walking, stairs, etc.) that a typical person encounters in their daily life. This prosthesis must also mimic the gait patterns of able-bodied individuals within a range of uncertainty. For the prosthesis to be successful, it must have a RoM within ±10% of the total RoM of a biological ankle.",

      "The VEST project is a noninvasive wearable vest for dogs that enables continuous monitoring of health and physiological condition across breeds and sizes. It tracks body temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate, and uses a robotics-based auto-tightening mechanism for proper sensor contact. Data is sent in real time to a mobile app for owners and veterinarians, enabling early detection of health issues.\n\nMotivation: Inspired by real cases—a team member's Pomeranian with tracheomalacia, where early respiratory monitoring could have enabled timely intervention, and the loss of Reveille IX, Texas A&M's mascot, to pneumonia, where continuous vital sign tracking could have provided unmistakable evidence for earlier treatment. These experiences highlight the need for objective, real-time monitoring to improve canine health outcomes.",
    purpose:
      "Develop a vest that provides reliable, real-time vital sign monitoring for dogs, ensuring comfort and adaptability for all breeds and sizes, and supporting early intervention for health complications.",
    background:
      "Inspired by: 1) A team member's Pomeranian with tracheomalacia (early respiratory monitoring could have helped). 2) The passing of Reveille IX, Texas A&M mascot, from pneumonia (continuous vital sign tracking could have enabled earlier intervention).",
    motivation:
      "This project was motivated by personal experiences with canine health challenges, including a team member's Pomeranian diagnosed with tracheomalacia and the loss of Reveille IX, Texas A&M's mascot, to pneumonia. Both cases highlighted the need for continuous, objective monitoring of vital signs to enable earlier intervention and better outcomes for dogs.",
